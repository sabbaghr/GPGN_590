# Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the code and details for a low-cost infrasound wave sensor. Infrasound waves are a type of sound wave with frequencies below the human audible thresholdâ€”typically under 20 Hz. These waves can travel long distances and originate from both natural and artificial sources. Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and even some animals, such as elephants and whales, which use infrasound to communicate over vast distances. Artificial sources include nuclear and chemical explosions, as well as machinery like diesel engines and wind turbines. Devices like woofers and subwoofers can also produce low-frequency sound, including near-infrasound frequencies.

In this experiment, we used a speaker equipped with a woofer to generate low-frequency sounds. Our sensor successfully detected the pressure field created by these waves, demonstrating its functionality as an infrasound sensor.

Infrasound waves generated by earthquakes have been recorded using balloon-based barometers, as shown in studies by Garcia et al. (2022) and Krishnamoorthy et al. (2019). Such sensors have also been proposed for studying the internal structure of planetary bodies, like Venus, as described by Garcia et al. (2005). This highlights the diverse applications of infrasound sensors, from Earth-based studies to planetary exploration.

This project represents our first attempt to develop a low-cost infrasound sensor. While significant improvements are needed to create a sensor suitable for deployment on a balloon, our prototype successfully detected low-frequency sound waves generated by a speaker, demonstrating its potential for further development.

#Circuit desing: 

### BMP 390 and GRS: 
Our sensors is separated in two parts. The first part consits of the GPS and BMP390 barometric pressure sensor. The data from this part of the sensor is transfered using the Xbee communications system, the figure below shows the circuit design and how the barometric pressure sensor and the GPS are connected to the Arduino UNO. Since, the sensors are going to be deployed in the field we add a 9V batteery to power the arduinos and the sensors. The battery is connected to the soldering board, from the soldering the board we connect the BMP390 Baromentric pressure sensor and the Arduino UNO. The BMP390 is conected to the 6,7,8, and 9 pins of the Arudino. For the GPS module, we have that the power is coming form the arduino, and then from the GPS TX goes to the pin 4 RX to pin 3, SDA and SCL goes to pin A4 and A5.

# Implementation 
Wired things together 

# General Testing 
tested with simple pulses generated by acoustic source. Also attempted to test with a song, but SDP810-25 sampling was too coarse to appropriately reconstruct high frequency signal of human range. More ideal test would be to use a very low chirped source at constant frequency with known perturbation and timing. 

# Aplication 
balloon-based infrasound detection. can be attached to a free floating balloon to detect infrasound induced by earthquakes, volcanic events, chemical blasts, or other low frequency, high energy events. Ideally could deploy several of these devices to better understand the air column between detectors. Also allows for source localization. Potentially very useful in planetary exploration of heavy atmospheric bodies like Venus. Could detect transmitted P-wave energy (strong coupling) to use for seismic experiments. With several such devices, might be possible to perform SI and thus tomographic imaging of the near surface and air column using ambient infrasound. 

# Discussion 
Sensirion sucks. 

# Future Work
New differential pressure sensor. Test with 2 barometric sensors and see if they can be calibrated against each other to act as a differential pressure sensor. Test with some better sources. Deploy on CU balloon.
