# Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the code and details for a low-cost infrasound wave sensor. Infrasound waves are a type of sound wave with frequencies below the human audible thresholdâ€”typically under 20 Hz. These waves can travel long distances and originate from both natural and artificial sources. Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and even some animals, such as elephants and whales, which use infrasound to communicate over vast distances. Artificial sources include nuclear and chemical explosions, as well as machinery like diesel engines and wind turbines. Devices like woofers and subwoofers can also produce low-frequency sound, including near-infrasound frequencies.

In this experiment, we used a speaker equipped with a woofer to generate low-frequency sounds. Our sensor successfully detected the pressure field created by these waves, demonstrating its functionality as an infrasound sensor.

Infrasound waves generated by earthquakes have been recorded using balloon-based barometers, as shown in studies by Garcia et al. (2022) and Krishnamoorthy et al. (2019). Such sensors have also been proposed for studying the internal structure of planetary bodies, like Venus, as described by Garcia et al. (2005). This highlights the diverse applications of infrasound sensors, from Earth-based studies to planetary exploration.

This project represents our first attempt to develop a low-cost infrasound sensor. While significant improvements are needed to create a sensor suitable for deployment on a balloon, our prototype successfully detected low-frequency sound waves generated by a speaker, demonstrating its potential for further development.

# Design 

Parts: 
1. 9V Battery power 
2. SDP810-125 differential pressure 
3. BMP390 barometric pressure sensor 
4. Xbee shield 
5. SD card storage 
6. GPS module 
7. 3D printed case and ports 


### Circuit desing: 
Our sensor system is divided into two main components. The first component includes the GPS module and the BMP390 barometric pressure sensor. The second component of the sensor is the Differential pressure sensor. 

#### BMP 390 and GRS: 
The first component of the sensor includes the BMP390 barometric pressure sensor and the GPS module. Data from these components is transmitted using the XBee communication system. The diagram below illustrates the circuit design, showing how these components are connected to the Arduino UNO.

For field deployment, a 9V battery powers the Arduino and the sensors. The battery is connected to a soldering board, which supplies power to both the BMP390 sensor and the Arduino UNO. The BMP390 sensor connects to pins 6, 7, 8, and 9 on the Arduino UNO.

For the GPS module:

Power is supplied by the Arduino.
The GPS TX pin connects to Arduino pin 4, and the GPS RX pin connects to Arduino pin 3.
SDA and SCL lines are connected to Arduino pins A4 and A5, respectively.

#### SDP810-125 Differential Pressure Sensor

The second component of the sensor system is the differential pressure sensor. In this configuration, a 9V battery powers a second soldering board, which supplies power to the Arduino Nano and the differential pressure sensor.

Data recorded by the differential pressure sensor is stored on an SD card. To ensure proper communication between the differential pressure sensor and the Arduino Nano, 10K ohm resistors are added to the connections. The SD card reader is also connected to the Arduino Nano to store the recorded data from the sensor.

# Implementation 
Wired things together 

# General Testing 
tested with simple pulses generated by acoustic source. Also attempted to test with a song, but SDP810-25 sampling was too coarse to appropriately reconstruct high frequency signal of human range. More ideal test would be to use a very low chirped source at constant frequency with known perturbation and timing. 

# Aplication 
balloon-based infrasound detection. can be attached to a free floating balloon to detect infrasound induced by earthquakes, volcanic events, chemical blasts, or other low frequency, high energy events. Ideally could deploy several of these devices to better understand the air column between detectors. Also allows for source localization. Potentially very useful in planetary exploration of heavy atmospheric bodies like Venus. Could detect transmitted P-wave energy (strong coupling) to use for seismic experiments. With several such devices, might be possible to perform SI and thus tomographic imaging of the near surface and air column using ambient infrasound. 

# Discussion 
Sensirion sucks. 

# Future Work
New differential pressure sensor. Test with 2 barometric sensors and see if they can be calibrated against each other to act as a differential pressure sensor. Test with some better sources. Deploy on CU balloon.
